# Exporting to Figma

Crylic has the ability to perform a basic export of elements to Figma.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some parts of the export are not supported currently, such as images.\


Importing components back to Crylic from Figma is not currently supported.
{% endhint %}

### Exporting from Crylic

To start, open a project within Crylic and select the element you want to export.

Copy this data for the next section.

### Importing from Figma

Within Figma, create a new document and open the Crylic Figma Plugin (available [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1095578080264600867/Crylic)).

Paste the export data from the previous section and select import.

You should now have the elements from Crylic imported within Figma!
