# Component Library

A popular pattern in web development is to have a set of well defined components that can be used throughout the website. Crylic is well suited to creating, editing, and styling such components.

During the Open Alpha, Crylic will be limited to basic style and component editing. Additional capabilities, such as creating variants and supporting more frameworks will be added over time. Let us know what features you'd like to see at [info@crylic.io](mailto:info@crylic.io) or within the in-app feedback form!
