# Intro to Crylic

{% hint style="warning" %}
Crylic is currently in an Open Alpha. Features, configurations, and documentation are subject to frequent changes during this phase. Feel free to send us an email at [info@crylic.io](mailto:info@crylic.io) for any questions or feedback, we'd love to hear from you!
{% endhint %}

Crylic is a design tool that edits code.

> Not export, not generate, _edit_.

This means that Crylic can be used to edit existing codebases, and there's no migration if you stop using the tool as it only changes code!

Currently Crylic supports React projects, but we're working on adding more frameworks, such as Angular & Vue.

### Getting Started

Crylic can be used by **both designers and developers.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Some aspects of Crylic require technical skills, such as [onboarding existing projects](./onboarding/), but overall it's designed to be used without any technical knowledge.

Due to Crylic's position as a tool that straddles the designer and developer worlds, documentation may sometimes be developer focused.
