# What is Crylic?

**Thanks for trying out Crylic! We hope you love it ðŸš€**

Crylic is a design tool that edits code.

> Not export, not generate, _edit_.

This means that Crylic can be used to edit existing codebases, and there's no migration if you stop using the tool as it only changes code!

Currently Crylic supports React projects, but we're working on adding more frameworks, such as Angular & Vue.
