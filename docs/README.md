# Intro to Crylic

{% hint style="warning" %}
Crylic is currently in an Open Alpha. Features, configurations, and documentation are subject to frequent changes during this phase. Feel free to send us an email at [info@crylic.io](mailto:info@crylic.io) for any questions or feedback, we'd love to hear from you!
{% endhint %}

Crylic is a design tool that edits code.

> Not export, not generate, _edit_.

This means that Crylic can be used to edit existing codebases, and there's no migration if you stop using the tool as it only changes code!

Crylic is a new software platform, and right now is focused on [creating basic components and editing styles](overview/walkthrough.md). Over time more no-code features will be added, such as handling state, creating variants of components, and working with a backend. Currently Crylic supports React projects, with support for more frameworks, such as Angular & Vue, planned in the future.

### Getting Started

Crylic can be used by **both designers and developers.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Some aspects of Crylic require technical skills, such as [onboarding existing projects](onboarding/), but overall it's designed to be used without any technical knowledge.

Due to Crylic's position as a tool that straddles the designer and developer worlds, documentation may sometimes be developer focused.
