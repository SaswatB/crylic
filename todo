implemented features:
- generate boilerplate for new projects & components
- edit element properties (size, position, layout, fill...) in gui, with live code changes
- set frame size
- resize elements in live view
- live view of component
- select element by cursor in editor + selection view
- add elements by dropping on live view
- webpack build system to support most project configurations and generate live view
  - run on a child thread to avoid ui lock ups
- edit styled components css within the template automatically
- multiple files open at the same time (with element selection between them)
- edit stylesheets from elements
- get smooth/instant feedback on many style changes
- per project configuration with support for component bootstrap scripts
- outline view of components
- react router support
- guided tour
- availble for win+mac
- view your project in a browser

qa checklist:
- able to creating a working new project
- able to load an existing project
- outline works
- routing works
- publish works
- select element works
- element editor works
- selected element stays selected between renders
- save works
- able to add new elements and have them be selected on refresh
- check code editor w/ syntax highlighting and selected element highlight

current limitations:
~- only works on projects that use the default cra setup~
- untested redux
- only works on react
- slow startup/build
- changes may be slow to reflect on frame, esp if there are images
- one component per file (ideally one export)
- cannot create css classes
- doesn't support experimental js syntax that's not handled by babel's core parser
- doesn't support createElement() or create-react-class
- bootstrap file requires a single function import
- component files must start with an uppercase letter to be renderable
